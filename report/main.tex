% OUTLINE

% Introduction
%	Descirption of the problem
% 	Overview of our approach
%		Used a PID controller to handle a lot of the movement
%		Did some odometry testing to assist with other movements

% Methods
%	Testing, getting to know the robot
%		clicks to cm conversion
%		etc
%	Setting up the odometry
%
%	Describe in detail how the important parts of each task were accomplished
%		general line following
%			tuning the PID
%		navigating from one line to the next in the broken line
%			using PID break case
%		navigating around the object
%			detection
%			turning
%			tuning PID with the goal distance
%				problems with the sonar pointing at the corner of the box - it wan't reading that as being close to the robot due to what we talked about in lecture about donar getting deflected not perpendicularly
%			finding the line again


% Results
%	Data from testing of robot
%		PID graphs for line following and obstacle avoiding
%	Data from reliability of odometry system

% Discussion
%	Successes
%	Limitations
%	Problems/Improvements
